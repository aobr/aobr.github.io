						<h2>Galactic Structure Finder (<tt>gsf</tt>)</h2>
    <p align="justify"> Galaxies are usually classified according to their appearance as either late type (barred or non-barred spirals and irregulars) 
      or early type (ellipticals). Lenticular galaxies represent the transition between these two classes. These classes can be understood as 
      forming an evolutionary sequence. Ellipticals are older and less organised internally due to mergers, whereas spirals are younger and 
      have distinct features such as disks, bulges, bars and spiral arms. Spirals are also thought to have experienced a less violent merger history. 
      If we can causally link the presence of substructures (and their properties) to specific events and their timings, 
      we can effectively build a <tt>timeoscope</tt> to look backwards in time at observed galaxies. 
      Additionally, specific features could offer insights into the surrounding dark matter. 
      To this end, I have developed an analysis code that can segment simulated galaxies into physically meaningful components.

      The first version of <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.477.4915O" style="color:#DAA520"><tt>Galactic Structure Finder (gsf)</tt></a>, 
      which is mainly written in Python, uses direct N-body summation in Fortran-OpenMP to accurately compute gravitational forces. 
      It can identify dynamical structures such as thin/thick disks, bulges, spheroids and stellar halos within a fixed 3D angular momentum-energy space. 
      The rationale behind this code was the need for a data-driven galaxy segmentation instead of a model-driven segmentation, 
      where restrictive and poorly founded physical distribution functions would have to be assumed for the various components. 
      After experimenting with various clustering algorithms, I opted for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and developed the code as an 
      advanced usage wrapper for the GMM class in the open-source library <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/" style="color:#DAA520"><tt>scikit-learn</tt></a>.

    <font color=black> Tracing back in time the Lagrangian mass of some individual dynamical components of a simulated spiral galaxy. In the teenager years of 
      the Universe (1st column panels) the stellar thin-disk-to-be was only f=1% stars and spread into large filamentary structures, while the stellar halo-to-be 
      was much more compact and already 27% in stellar form. Adapted from <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.477.4915O" style="color:#DAA520"> 2018MNRAS.477.4915O </a> </font>

      The second version of the code (<a href="https://github.com/aobr/gsf2" style="color:#DAA520"> <tt>gsf2</tt></a>) 
      goes a long way in the direction of automating the whole galaxy analysis process. 
      The code now has two information criteria that can be used to select <i>an optimal number of components</i>, 
      a naming scheme based on physical properties and the ability to select from an infinite range of feature spaces. 
      It is the latter code feature in particular that has enabled us to devise a method of isolating galaxy bars, 
      which are notoriously difficult to separate from the other components.
