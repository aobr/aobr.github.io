						<h2>The QSO MUSEUM survey </h2>


  <p align="justify"> Accreting supermassive black holes, also known as active galactic nuclei (AGN), are found in all types of galaxies throughout cosmic time. 
    In their most active phase, AGN act as lighthouses, illuminating their gaseous environments <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stx2465" style="color:#DAA520"> 
    sometimes on gigantic scales</a>.
    These large-scale glows, observed as diffuse Lyman &alpha; line emission, provide important information on the baryon budget in the CGM, as well as on gas properties 
    such as temperature, density, composition and ionisation state on these scales.  Moreover, <it>these observations are key to understanding and modelling the effects of 
    AGN feedback on their galactic environments</it>.

    The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/sty2827" style="color:#DAA520">QSO MUSEUM survey</a> began as a programme to detect Ly&alpha; nebulae around a wide range 
    of luminous z~3 quasars using MUSE@VLT. The initial sample has recently been extended to include the faint end of AGN luminosity at this redshift. 
    The resulting dataset of 120 targets was reduced and analysed homogeneously, 
    resulting in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250716898G/abstract" style="color:#DAA520">
    the first statistically significant detection of AGN feedback effects on CGM scales</a>.

      masses ~10<sup>9</sup>M<sub>&#9737;</sub>. As the CGM properties are expected to be similar across this galaxy sample, the differences in the profiles are a direct 
      consequence of variations in quasar activity/accretion rates.

      The survey also detected <a href="https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201936211" style="color:#DAA520">bridges of cool gas between quasar pairs</a>, 
      and is currently extended to look for such <a href="https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202450959" style="color:#DAA520">bridges at various quasar separations</a>. 
      To understand both the large scale environment of these quasars as well as their galaxy hosts, our team is doing follow-up observatios with various instruments 
      (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202245520" style="color:#DAA520">SCUBA-2@JCMT</a>, <a href="10.3847/1538-4357/ac5a4d" style="color:#DAA520">the AMUSE<sup>2</sup> programme</a>).
