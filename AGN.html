						<h2>AGN radiation effects in simulated galaxies </h2>

    <p align="justify"> Accreting supermassive black holes, also known as active galactic nuclei (AGN), emit copious amounts of ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray 
      photons that can significantly impact the surrounding gas, from the small interstellar medium (ISM) to the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and beyond. 
      In simulations, this largely unknown physical phenomenon is implemented in two ways: as a release of thermal energy, or as a momentum boost to nearby 
      gas particles/cells. The direct effect of AGN radiation on the heating and cooling terms in the energy equation is usually ignored. 
      In a recent <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stad3410" style="color:#DAA520">paper</a>, we demonstrated that this radiation effect alone can significantly 
      alter the balance between heating and cooling in the CGM of a massive simulated galaxy at redshift z = 3. Overcooling of the CGM is suppressed by a factor depending 
      on the solid angle through which this radiation can propagate (corresponding to the vertex angle &alpha; of a bi-cone).

      <font color=black> The mass budget of a simulated galaxy's CGM as a function of the vertex angle where AGN radiation can propagate. As &alpha; increases 
        (&alpha;=0<sup>o</sup> corresponds to no AGN radiation, while &alpha;=180<sup>o</sup> to isotropic AGN radiation) less/more of the CGM is cooling/heating. 
        These effects depend also on how massive is the black hole and how strong is the accretion (&lambda;=L<sub>bol</sub>/L<sub>Edd</sub>). Figure adapted from

      AGN radiation also affects CGM observables. By combining observations of various line emissions with absorption studies, we demonstrated that it may be possible 
      to constrain the intrinsic properties of the CGM (density, temperature, composition, and ionisation state) and the properties of the AGN radiation source (mass, 
      accretion rate, and vertex angle of the ionisation cone). The figure below shows how the averaged observed surface brightness radial profiles compare with four 
      AGN radiation models applied in post-processing to a massive simulated galaxy.

        To realise the full potential of this idea, I have created a large database of AGN photoionisation models for use in simulations and in an inference 
        pipeline that constrains the CGM and AGN properties of real galaxies in tandem.
