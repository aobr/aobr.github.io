						<h2>Estimating CGM and AGN properties with simulations and machine learning </h2>

    <p align="justify"> Our work on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stad3410" style="color:#DAA520">AGN radiation effects on the CGM</a> only scratched 
      the surface of the possibilities of using nebular emission to measure in tandem the CGM and AGN properties. To fulfill this potential, we have created a 
      large database of photoionization models with <a href="https://www.astroscu.unam.mx/rmaa/RMxAA..53-2/PDF/RMxAA..53-2_gferland.pdf" style="color:#DAA520">Cloudy</a>, 
      varying the AGN spectrum to cover the full range of observed black hole (BH) masses and activity rates, and the broad range of possible CGM properties.

      <font color=black> Left: distribution of AGN spectrum parameters (left) compared to the distribution of SDSS quasars (colored image) in the space of BH 
        mass (horizontal axis) and accretion rate (vertical axis). Right: variation of AGN spectrum with the accretion rate &lambda; for fixed BH mass and distance 
        between AGN and gas patch. 
        The continuum is computed with the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.19779.x" style="color:#DAA520"><tt>OPTXAGN</tt></a> code 
        and the lines are scaled to the continuum based on the SDSS line estimates of <a href="10.3847/1538-4365/ab99c5" style="color:#DAA520">Rakshit et al. (2020</a>).

        Each black point in the top left figure represents a family of 4D models with a fixed incident spectral shape. 
        The 4D parameters are the flux normalisation (distance to the source) and the gas temperature, density and composition. 
        Running all these models took approximately six months of wall-clock time on an AMD EPYC 7713 64-Core Processor 
        and generated around 15 Tb of data. Before we can move on to the exciting part of training compact and fast machine 
        learning (ML) models for inference on this data, the raw, messy outputs need to be processed into well-behaved 6D arrays.
