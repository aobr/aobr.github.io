						<h2>GRASIL-3D</h2>

      To test the galaxy formation models we assume in simulation codes we need to 
      forward model the simulation outputs (time dependent mass, 6D position-velocities, plus star and gas specific properties) to 
      observables (broad band images, spectra, integral field unit cubes). This forward modeling is performed with dedicated radiation transfer codes, 
      which have to account also for dust. Dust grains in the interstellar medium (ISM) and in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) absorb 
      high energy photons (ultraviolet) and re-emit at longer wavelengths (infrared). As a consequence, galaxies look very different depending on the 
      particular wavelength at which they are observed.

      is a radiative transfer, ray tracing, fixed grid code written in Fortran/MPI, which couples the dust models in

      with the output of cosmological simulations. I have implemented the imaging module for <tt>GRASIL-3D</tt>, 
      including the post-processing code that takes into account the redshift and outputs spectral 
      energy distributions and images in bands ranging from far ultraviolet (GALEX/FUV) to far infrared (Herschel/SPIRE).  
      The figure shows how a simulated spiral galaxy changes its appearence depending of the viewing angle (face-on top vs edge-on bottom) 
      and the spectral window of the observing instrument from far UV (left), to visible blue B (center left), to infrared IR (center right) 
      and far IR (right).
